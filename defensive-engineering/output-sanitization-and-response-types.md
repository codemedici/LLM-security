# Output Sanitization & Response Types

## Output Sanitization & Response Types

Output sanitization and structured response types are essential defensive mechanisms designed to limit the risks associated with uncontrolled or malicious outputs generated by LLM systems. By constraining and validating model-generated content, these techniques reduce the likelihood of data leaks, unauthorized commands execution, or downstream vulnerabilities.

***

### üéØ Importance & Risk Scenarios

When outputs from an LLM aren't properly sanitized or structured, several critical risks can emerge:

* **Code Execution Risks:** Unsanitized outputs might include harmful shell commands, SQL injections, or JavaScript snippets, triggering dangerous behavior when parsed or executed.
* **Data Leakage:** Sensitive or confidential information may inadvertently be disclosed through model outputs.
* **Ambiguous or Misleading Content:** Users might misinterpret or misuse ambiguous outputs, leading to incorrect or harmful decisions.

For example, an LLM-powered assistant inadvertently generates a response containing a database query command, which could be executed if downstream processes interpret outputs without validation.

### üõ†Ô∏è Sanitization Techniques and Structured Response Implementation

| Technique                          | Implementation & Explanation                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured Output Formats**      | Mandate outputs in structured formats (JSON, XML, markdown tables), simplifying parsing and validation processes downstream.                      |
| **Output Filtering & Escaping**    | Apply sanitization rules to escape or remove special characters, code-like syntax, or potentially harmful content in outputs.                     |
| **Response Validation Schemas**    | Implement rigid schema validation (e.g., JSON Schema, Pydantic models) ensuring outputs adhere strictly to expected structures and content types. |
| **Contextual Output Restrictions** | Limit allowable output types or commands contextually, based on user roles or task contexts, reducing unnecessary risk exposure.                  |
| **Interactive Output Controls**    | Allow controlled user interaction (confirmation dialogs or preview mechanisms) for sensitive or risky generated outputs.                          |

### üöß Common Anti-patterns

* Permitting unrestricted natural-language outputs without validation or structured constraints.
* Failing to sanitize or escape potentially executable code snippets or special characters in model outputs.
* Using weak or absent schema validation, allowing ambiguous or unintended outputs to pass through.

Avoid these pitfalls by rigorously implementing structured response protocols and comprehensive output validation systems.

### üß™ Red Team Probes

* Craft inputs designed explicitly to produce executable or harmful outputs, testing output sanitization effectiveness.
* Attempt to bypass structured format requirements by injecting unexpected or malformed content.
* Evaluate system behavior when outputs contain sensitive or confidential data, verifying sanitization effectiveness.
* Probe interactive output controls by generating risky or ambiguous outputs, testing user interface controls and validation workflows.

These proactive measures ensure output sanitization mechanisms robustly prevent harmful or unintended content generation.
