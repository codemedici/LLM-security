# Interpretable Outputs and Trust Calibration

## Why Interpretability Matters

Even correct-looking outputs can hide flawed reasoning. Trust calibration helps ensure users understand when to rely on the model â€” and when not to.

## Techniques for Interpretability

* **Rationale Extraction**\
  Prompt model to explain its answer ("chain-of-thought" prompting).
* **Intermediate Steps Display**\
  Show reasoning steps or tool calls made during output generation.
* **Attention Heatmaps**\
  Visualize which input tokens influenced specific outputs (requires model internals).
* **Token Attribution**\
  Highlight which prompt segments triggered particular parts of the output.

## Example: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

```python
prompt = "Q: How many legs do two cats and one dog have?\nA: Let's think step by step."
```

* Encourages models to expose reasoning
* Easier to debug hallucinations and logic gaps

## Trust Calibration Tools

| Method                      | Purpose                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Self-evaluation             | Ask the model to rate its confidence    |
| Refusal justifications      | Explain why it cannot answer            |
| Epistemic uncertainty flags | Indicate where it is unsure or guessing |

## Example: Self-Evaluation Prompt

```
Answer the question and then state your confidence (low, medium, high) and why.
```

## UI Design Recommendations

* Show reasoning + answer side-by-side
* Highlight uncertainty via tone, color, or badges
* Allow user feedback loop (thumbs up/down, report issue)

## Placement in Notebook

* New page under Defensive Engineering
* Cross-link with Evaluation & Hardening for traceability audits
