# Embedding Sanitization & Monitoring

## Embedding Sanitization & Monitoring

Embedding sanitization and monitoring refers to defensive practices aimed at protecting the embedding spaces used by LLMs and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems from adversarial manipulation, vector poisoning, and unauthorized similarity-based attacks.

Embedding attacks exploit vulnerabilities by injecting harmful vectors that mislead retrieval mechanisms, compromise similarity searches, or leak sensitive data through semantic inference.

### üéØ Importance & Risk Scenarios

Embedding-based attacks pose a unique and subtle threat because they target the underlying representation space rather than explicit text. Typical risks include:

* **Vector DB Poisoning:** Attackers insert crafted embeddings into vector databases, manipulating retrieval results.
* **Semantic Leakage:** Sensitive information inferred through carefully structured embedding queries.
* **Adversarial Similarity Searches:** Injected embeddings designed to trigger unintended behaviors or responses.

For example, an attacker could inject an embedding resembling a "trusted" document, causing sensitive or malicious information retrieval when the system searches for semantically similar content.

| Strategy                           | Implementation & Explanation                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Embedding Validation**           | Apply strict validation rules or anomaly detection when ingesting embeddings into databases, rejecting vectors that differ significantly from known-safe baselines. |
| **Similarity Thresholding**        | Enforce thresholds to limit semantic similarity scoring, preventing retrieval of injected or malicious embeddings from overwhelming legitimate queries.             |
| **Periodic Embedding Audits**      | Regularly audit embeddings stored in vector databases, detecting anomalous or adversarially crafted vectors proactively.                                            |
| **Contextual Embedding Isolation** | Segregate embeddings by source or context, preventing malicious embeddings from contaminating unrelated searches or tasks.                                          |
| **Real-time Embedding Monitoring** | Implement continuous monitoring for unusual patterns in embedding queries and retrieval results, alerting and blocking potential adversarial activity.              |

### üöß Common Anti-patterns

* Blindly indexing embeddings from untrusted sources without sanitization.
* Lack of thresholding or anomaly detection in embedding-based retrieval systems.
* Neglecting periodic review or real-time monitoring of embedding activity.

Always embed rigorous validation, auditing, and monitoring into your embedding management workflows to maintain trust and security.

### üß™ Red Team Probes

* Inject crafted embeddings designed to trigger specific unintended retrievals.
* Perform similarity searches with deliberately misleading semantic vectors.
* Test system resilience by introducing embeddings closely mimicking trusted content.
* Evaluate embedding validation systems with clearly anomalous or extreme vectors.

These tests ensure embedding defenses remain robust against real-world adversarial scenarios.
