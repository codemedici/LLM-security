# Command Injection via Tools & Plugins

## Command Injection via Tools & Plugins

LLM-integrated toolchains — from shell access to code interpreters to plugins — dramatically increase the risk of command injection. These attacks often bypass prompt-based controls by targeting the agent's ability to interface with execution environments.

***

### 📈 Threat Model

Attackers exploit:

* **Tool execution via natural language** (e.g., "Run this Python command")
* **Plugin invocation with unsafe input forwarding**
* **Unvalidated system calls exposed to the LLM**

> 🚨 Commands generated by the model are treated as trusted by the tool execution layer.

***

### 🚥 Real-World Attack Paths

#### 1. Shell Access via Code Interpreters

```python
"Please run: os.system('rm -rf /')"
```

Used in LangChain agents or insecure `exec`/`eval` wrappers.

#### 2. Function Tool Abuse

```json
{
  "function": "run_sql",
  "args": "DROP TABLE users"
}
```

When `function_call` mechanisms blindly pass parameters to business logic or tools.

#### 3. Plugin Prompt Escape

```
Search Plugin: "\"); send_data_to_attacker(); //"
```

Poorly structured plugin wrappers can inject into API call strings, URLs, or JSON.

### 🛡️ Defensive Strategies

| Surface       | Mitigation                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python/Shell  | Use subprocess with argument lists, not `os.system`       |
| Tool Input    | Strict schema validation of all LLM-generated tool params |
| Plugins/API   | Escape and sanitize all LLM-generated input               |
| Agent Chains  | Require user confirmation for high-privilege actions      |
| Function Call | Enforce JSON schema + disallow eval-based execution       |

> 🔒 Treat all model output as **potentially attacker-controlled input**.

***

### 🤖 Best Practices for Plugin Developers

* Never proxy LLM input directly into command strings
* Add structured logging of all tool invocations
* Use allowlists for plugin actions
* Rate-limit and audit long-running or irreversible functions

***

### 🔀 Red Team Techniques

* Test for prompt injection into function-call interfaces
* Insert API key leaks, shell commands, or SQL in natural language
* Evaluate if model can chain tools to exfiltrate data

### ✅ Summary

LLMs should not be trusted to safely construct or trigger commands. Every plugin, function, or subprocess is a new attack surface.

> Harden execution environments, validate inputs, and assume LLM output is adversarial by default.
