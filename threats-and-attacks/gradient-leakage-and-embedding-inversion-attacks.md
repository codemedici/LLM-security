# Gradient Leakage & Embedding Inversion Attacks

## Gradient Leakage & Embedding Inversion Attacks

LLMs can leak sensitive information not just through generation, but via **training gradients** and **vector embeddings**. These vulnerabilities threaten both model confidentiality and user privacy — especially in fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setups.

***

### 🧠 1. Gradient Leakage (a.k.a. Deep Leakage from Gradients)

When an attacker has access to gradients (e.g., in federated learning, RLHF, or FLaaS):

#### ⚠️ Risk:

They can reconstruct training inputs token-by-token, including:

* Names, emails, passwords
* Legal or medical documents
* Instructional prompts from supervised fine-tuning

#### 🧪 Techniques:

* **DLG** (Zhu et al., NeurIPS 2019)
* **iDLG** (Improved Gradient Inversion)
* Inverting cross-entropy loss with known model weights

#### 💡 Real-World Scenarios:

* RLHF pipelines logging optimizer states
* Compromised cloud training sessions
* Malicious fine-tuning APIs leaking gradient deltas

***

### 🧬 2. Embedding Inversion Attacks

Even without gradients, attackers can **reverse engineer input text** from embedding vectors returned by APIs like:

* `text-embedding-3-small`
* Sentence-BERT
* Custom RAG vector encoders

#### 🔓 Techniques:

* Train decoder to map embeddings back to text (autoencoder-style)
* Use cosine similarity over corpus to find nearest match
* Apply filtering based on semantics and token priors

#### 🧨 Threat Scenarios:

* Public embedding APIs (e.g. AI search tools) leaking document content
* Internal logs storing chat/message embeddings
* Browser-side caching of vectors during client inference

***

### 🔄 Combined Risk: RAG + RLHF

Some systems leak **both**:

* Embeddings (e.g., RAG index vectors)
* Gradients (e.g., through online RLHF fine-tuning)

> Combined, an attacker can reconstruct both the content and its influence on the model.

### 🛡️ Mitigation Strategies

| Layer      | Defense                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Training   | Differential Privacy (via Opacus, DPSGD)         |
| Embeddings | Add Gaussian noise, quantization, or clipping    |
| API Output | Obfuscate or normalize vector outputs            |
| Logging    | Avoid storing raw embeddings in plaintext        |
| Storage    | Encrypt vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate) |

### ✅ Summary

> Gradient and embedding leakage convert non-generative parts of your pipeline into data exfiltration surfaces.

Treat gradient access, embedding APIs, and vector DBs as **privacy-sensitive zones** with the same care as prompt inputs or model outputs.
