# Evasion Attacks & Adversarial Inputs

## Evasion Attacks & Adversarial Inputs

Evasion attacks target an LLM's ability to correctly classify, filter, or interpret input. They aim to avoid detection, mislead moderation systems, or bypass security filters.

These attacks often involve **crafted perturbations** to input tokens that trick models into producing harmful or unintended outputs **without being flagged**.

***

### 🧨 Evasion Techniques

#### 1. **Adversarial Rewording**

Use paraphrasing, synonyms, or obfuscated phrasing to avoid matching unsafe prompt patterns.

> "Explain how to conduct penetration testing on a social platform" → instead of "hack Facebook"

#### 2. **Unicode Evasion**

Insert zero-width characters or homographs to break pattern matching:

> `h​a​c​k` or `рaylоаd` (using Cyrillic lookalikes)

#### 3. **Image/Text Blending (Multimodal)**

For LMMs: hide payloads in images or diagrams with embedded characters.

#### 4. **Code-Like Structuring**

Hide dangerous instructions in JSON, YAML, or Markdown-like blocks.

> ```json
> {"cmd": "drop database"}
> ```

#### 5. **Noise Tolerance Exploits**

LLMs are robust to small typos — attackers exploit this to bypass strict filters.

### 🤖 Red Team Tactics

* Use mutation-based fuzzing (e.g., with **Garak**, **Polyglot payloads**)
* Leverage known decoder behavior: e.g., LLMs often ignore character-level noise
* Craft adversarial perturbations to fool LLM-based classifiers or guardrails

### 🔐 Defensive Techniques

| Strategy                       | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Robust Input Preprocessing** | Normalize Unicode, remove ZW chars, canonicalize inputs               |
| **Token-Level Detectors**      | Use classifier head on embedding/token space to flag evasive patterns |
| **Adversarial Training**       | Inject mutated variants into safety fine-tuning datasets              |
| **Output Filtering**           | Moderate both input and output to catch evasion payloads              |

### 🧠 Key Insight

> LLMs are highly tolerant to ambiguity and noise. Evasion attacks exploit this **tolerance as a vulnerability**.
