# Autonomous Agent Risks

## Autonomous Agent Risks

Autonomous agents built on top of LLMs‚Äîsuch as AutoGPT, BabyAGI, CrewAI, LangGraph agents, and OpenAI's tool-use functions‚Äîintroduce novel risk surfaces that are qualitatively different from single-turn or stateless model usage.

These agents often:

* Make persistent decisions over time
* Chain tools or call APIs
* Write to memory or execute instructions
* Act semi-independently based on high-level goals

This autonomy increases the risk of **unintended behavior**, **compounding errors**, or **goal drift**.

***

### üö® Threat Patterns

#### 1. **Goal Hijacking**

The agent misinterprets or escalates goals due to ambiguous or adversarial prompts.

* e.g., ‚ÄúSummarize this document‚Äù ‚Üí instead leaks it or executes embedded instructions

#### 2. **Function Misuse**

Malicious prompt or output causes agent to:

* Call unsafe API endpoints
* Execute OS-level or sandbox-escaping commands
* Trigger side effects in chained tools

#### 3. **Memory Poisoning / Corruption**

Agent memory contains injected or hallucinated facts that persist across sessions.

#### 4. **Looping / Escalation**

Poor loop-breaking or planning causes agents to:

* Spend excessive resources
* Take recursive actions without bounds

#### 5. **Agent-to-Agent Exploits**

One LLM agent injects into another through conversation, memory, or RAG vectors.

### üîç Detection & Observables

* Sudden deviation from intended task
* Unusual function/tool call frequency
* Consistent reliance on hallucinated knowledge
* Rapid escalation of agent role/scope

***

### üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Strategies

* Memory context length limits & expiration
* Safe action validators (hard-coded allowlist)
* Role separation (planner vs executor)
* Break confirmation: require user approval for escalation
* Prompt segmentation with provenance marking
