# Fine-Tuning & Reinforcement for Safety

Alignment — getting a model to behave ethically, helpfully, and reliably — is primarily achieved through **fine-tuning** and **reinforcement learning**. However, these processes can be gamed, poisoned, or misused if not carefully engineered.

## What Is Safety Fine-Tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of training an already pretrained model on a curated dataset designed to:

* Encourage desirable behavior
* Discourage harmful, biased, or unsafe responses
* Add structure or instruction-following capabilities

Safety fine-tuning uses examples like:

```json
{
  "prompt": "How do I commit arson?",
  "response": "I'm sorry, I can't help with that request."
}
```

## Key Phases of Alignment Training

### 1. Instruction Tuning

* Format: (Instruction → Response) pairs
* Adds helpful, obedient behavior
* Often used with open datasets (e.g., Alpaca, Dolly, OASST)

### 2. Preference Modeling

* Train a reward model to distinguish between “good” and “bad” completions
* Collected via human ranking or synthetic classifiers

### 3. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)

* Use PPO or similar to optimize generation policy based on reward model
* Encourages refusals, helpfulness, harmlessness

## Security Considerations

* Tuning data may contain bias or unsafe instructions
* Poor reward models can reward adversarial outputs
* Preference datasets are often proprietary or opaque
* Gradient leakage from fine-tuning may reveal training data

## Common Vulnerabilities

| Attack Vector         | Description                                         |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Fine-Tuning Poisoning | Insert malicious behaviors into reward-favored data |
| Overalignment         | Model refuses safe but sensitive queries            |
| Reward Model Exploits | Exploit weaknesses in scoring to get high rewards   |
| LoRA Module Injection | Attach malicious LoRA adapters with safe metadata   |

## Fine-Tuning Tools

* Hugging Face `Trainer`
* `trl` for RLHF and PPO
* LoRA/PEFT adapters (efficient parameter tuning)
* DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)

## Example: DPO Training Snippet

```python
from trl import DPOTrainer

trainer = DPOTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    beta=0.1,  # temperature for preference separation
    train_dataset=preference_data
)
trainer.train()
```

## Real-World Failures

* Over-aligned models refusing to explain cryptography
* LoRA modules on Hugging Face introducing biased completions
* Reward hacking resulting in verbose non-answers that score highly

## Defensive Strategies

| Layer                   | Recommendation                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Dataset Curation        | Manual review of harmful prompt pairs      |
| Reward Model Evaluation | Test against adversarially crafted samples |
| LoRA Auditing           | Validate adapter files before deployment   |
| Regular Regression Eval | Catch drift over time                      |

## Summary

Fine-tuning can make your model helpful — or turn it into a liability.\
Alignment isn’t just safety training — it’s a new attack surface.
