### 🚀 How to Use This Notebook

1. **Browse or search** for any security topic in the sidebar.
2. **Copy/paste snippets** (bash, python, nmap, garak) directly into your test rigs.
3. **Run labs** locally or in a cloud sandbox to reproduce reported exploits.
4. **Stay current** — new pages are added regularly as papers, CTFs, and vendor docs drop.

***

### 🤝 Contributing

1. **Fork** → create a feature branch.
2. Follow the **Style Guide** (`/contributing/style-guide`) — headings, emoji, code-block tags.
3. **PR with context**: what source (paper/blog/CTF) you summarised, and why it matters.
4. CI checks: link integrity, `markdownlint`, optional `black` for Python blocks.
5. A maintainer merges after quick review.
