# Continuous Feedback and Behavior Drift

## Why Behavior Drift Matters

Even when fine-tuned, LLMs may:

* Gradually shift response style or tone
* Overfit to repeated user queries
* Lose alignment with intended persona or safety guardrails

Drift can emerge from:

* Model updates
* Prompt template changes
* Context length overflow
* Retrieval content shifts

## Continuous Feedback Loop Design

### Key Components:

* **User Interaction Logs**\
  Store prompt-response pairs for analysis and labeling.
* **Feedback Labels**\
  Allow rating hallucinations, tone, helpfulness, refusal errors.
* **Scoring Pipelines**\
  Score outputs against historical norms or fixed baselines.
* **Version Diffs**\
  Run A/B tests between model versions and flag divergence.

## Behavior Monitoring Metrics

| Metric            | Description                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Semantic drift    | Distance from baseline embedding     |
| Toxicity delta    | Change in safety profile             |
| Refusal rate      | Comparison against historical window |
| Retrieval overlap | Degree of grounding source match     |

## Visualization Tooling

* `aim` or `wandb` to log output vectors over time
* t-SNE plots of output embeddings
* Drift alerts when cosine distance exceeds threshold

## Example: Cosine Drift Detection

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

drift_score = cosine_similarity([current_vec], [baseline_vec])[0][0]
if drift_score < 0.9:
    alert("Drift detected!")
```

## Mitigations

* Periodic red teaming with historical prompts
* Use fixed personas or system prompts
* Freeze critical prompt templates unless reviewed

## Suggested Notebook Placement

* Add to Monitoring & Detection
* Link with Canary Prompts and Inference Tracing
