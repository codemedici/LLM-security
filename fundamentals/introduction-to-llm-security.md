# Introduction to LLM Security

Large Language Models (LLMs) have unlocked incredible productivity and conversational capabilities — but they also introduce a **new class of security vulnerabilities**. From prompt injection and jailbreaks to backdoored weights and inference-time exploits, LLMs must be evaluated with an adversarial mindset.

This notebook provides a practical reference for red teamers, penetration testers, ML engineers, and AI researchers working to **secure, attack, or audit** generative models in production.

## Why LLM Security Matters

| Risk Domain      | Real-World Impact                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Prompt Injection | Jailbreaking safety policies, plugin misuse      |
| Model Extraction | Intellectual property theft, training data leaks |
| Tool Abuse       | Unauthorized file access, command execution      |
| Data Poisoning   | Silent model manipulation at training time       |
| API Misuse       | Key leakage, misuse of inference infrastructure  |

LLMs differ from traditional software:

* Inputs and behavior are **non-deterministic**
* Attacks can be **semantic**, not syntactic
* Exploits may arise from **language**, not code

## What This Notebook Covers

* Practical attacks and detection techniques
* Tooling and red teaming methodologies
* Defensive strategies and risk mitigation
* Deployment surface analysis (cloud, edge, APIs)
* Reference guides for offensive and defensive workflows

Each section is structured as a **self-contained page**, optimized for use during audits, research, and security reviews.

## Audience

This notebook is intended for:

* 🛡️ Security engineers working on LLM safety
* 🧠 ML researchers studying adversarial AI
* 🔍 Penetration testers auditing AI deployments
* 🧰 Developers building GenAI applications
* 🗂️ Risk managers integrating LLMs into workflows

No deep ML theory required — this is a field manual.

## Scope of Attacks

The pages cover LLM attack surfaces across:

```
[Prompt Input] → [Pre/Post Processing] → [Model Inference] → [Tool Use / Output]
```

Each phase contains:

* **Attack vectors**
* **Detection strategies**
* **Real-world examples**
* **Hardening recommendations**

## Philosophy

* **Assume the model can be manipulated**
* **Trust boundaries must be redefined**
* **Security isn’t solved — it’s evaluated continuously**
