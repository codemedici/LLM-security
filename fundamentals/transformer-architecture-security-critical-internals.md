# Transformer Architecture: Security-Critical Internals

## Transformer Architecture: Security-Critical Internals

A strong understanding of transformer internals is essential for red teamers, auditors, and engineers attempting to detect or prevent adversarial modifications of model behavior.

***

### 🎯 Why Internals Matter

The transformer architecture enables flexibility — but this also creates **multiple injection points** for adversaries across pretraining, fine-tuning, or runtime.

**Security-critical tasks include:**

* Detecting **attention hijacks** and **gradient leakage**
* Locating potential **backdoor triggers**
* Analyzing **unsafe serialization and loading**
* Auditing **layer insertion during fine-tuning**

### 🧱 Core Components (Simplified)

| Module               | Function                                   | Risk Surface                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Embedding Layer      | Maps tokens to dense vectors               | Injection via poisoned vocab            |
| Positional Encoding  | Adds sequence order (sin/cos or learned)   | Overflow risks on long inputs           |
| Self-Attention Block | Computes dynamic focus per token (Q, K, V) | Hijack via manipulated `Q`, `K`, or `V` |
| Feedforward Network  | Non-linear transformation after attention  | Can hide malicious logic                |
| LayerNorm + Residual | Normalization and stabilization per block  | Used to suppress detection or output    |

### 🔍 Exploitable Internals

#### LayerNorm Disruption

* Custom epsilon values can **nullify forward output** or amplify noise.
* Backdoors may be inserted by modifying stabilization routines.

#### Positional Encoding Overflow

* Malformed input lengths may cause **alignment drift**, especially for extrapolating transformers.

#### Gradient Hijacking (Fine-Tuning Phase)

* Injecting layers that **intercept gradient flow** or re-route signal to unrelated layers.
* Typical in **LoRA** or **adapter-based** backdoors.

### 🧠 Attention Mechanism: Primary Risk Vector

```python
# Simplified attention formula
attention_scores = Q @ K.T / sqrt(d_k)
attention_weights = softmax(attention_scores)
output = attention_weights @ V
```

Manipulating any of the components:

* `Q` (Query) vectors → changes **what token attends to**
* `K` (Key) vectors → changes **how attention is shaped**
* `V` (Value) vectors → controls **what gets injected into output**

A poisoned `V` or a trigger-aligned `K` can reroute attention flow entirely.

***

### 🐍 Serialization Attack Surfaces

Transformers are commonly saved in formats like:

* `.pt`, `.bin`, `.ckpt`, `.pkl`, `.safetensors`

Risks:

* Embedded logic in attention layers
* Modified safetensors weights that activate only under trigger inputs
* Loader-time deserialization bugs (e.g., Pickle RCE)

🛡️ **Mitigation:**

* Use non-executable formats (e.g., safetensors)
* Validate architecture against trusted baselines
* Hash attention weights separately from adapter modules

***

### 🧬 Real-World Red Team Scenarios

* 🔓 Backdoors embedded into the attention score scale (e.g., trigger modifies denominator in `softmax`)
* 🧨 Trigger inputs modifying Q/K vector norms to reroute token output
* 🧪 Weight diff shows a 3-line change hijacking 12-layer output in decoder model

### ✅ Summary

Transformer internals are **not opaque math** — they are structured, attackable code.

> 🎯 Every attention block, residual connection, and norm layer is a potential control point for adversaries.

Red teamers and defenders should treat architecture audits as part of regular **model supply chain validation** — not only during pretraining, but especially before public deployment.
