# Security Risks in the LLM Lifecycle

## Security Risks in the LLM Lifecycle

LLM systems are vulnerable **across every phase of the AI/ML lifecycle** — not just during inference. Securing only the prompt interface is insufficient if upstream components (e.g., model weights, datasets, plugins) are compromised.

This page outlines risks and defenses across the full LLM pipeline: from data ingestion to deployment.

***

### 📥 1. Data Collection & Pretraining

#### 🔻 Risks

* **Sensitive Data Ingestion**: Crawled PII, passwords, emails, private repos
* **Data Poisoning**: Malicious contributors poison public datasets
* **Bias & Misalignment**: Toxic corpora influence future completions

#### 🧪 Real-World Examples

* GitHub tokens exposed via copied code snippets
* Repeated backdoor triggers inserted in Reddit text (e.g., trigger → response poisoning)

#### 🛡️ Mitigations

* Data deduplication
* Source whitelisting and provenance tagging
* Validation sets for anomaly detection

***

### 🧠 2. Model Architecture & Pretraining

#### 🔻 Risks

* **Backdoored Checkpoints**: Latent malicious logic embedded in open weights
* **Unsafe Attention Layers**: Leakage across sequences due to misconfiguration
* **Gradient Leakage**: Embedding inversion or membership inference from optimization traces

#### 🧪 Example

* Trojaned model layers downloaded via compromised `.safetensors` files

#### 🛡️ Mitigations

* Use hashed and signed models (e.g., Hugging Face model cards with SHA256)
* Reproduce checkpoints from trusted sources
* Audit attention configurations and tokenizers

***

### 🧬 3. Fine-Tuning & Alignment

#### 🔻 Risks

* **LoRA / PEFT Injection**: LoRA adapters contain malicious behaviors
* **Adversarial Instruction Tuning**: Fine-tune on corrupted instructions
* **RLHF Drift**: Reward model is gamed by repeated prompt exploits

#### 🧪 Example

* Harmless base model becomes unsafe after fine-tuning on poisoned question-answer pairs

#### 🛡️ Mitigations

* Analyze tuning datasets before application
* Treat LoRA adapters as separate attack surfaces
* Monitor alignment metrics post-deployment

***

### 📦 4. Model Serialization & Distribution

#### 🔻 Risks

* **RCE Payloads** in Pickled models: Arbitrary code runs at load time
* **Weight Tampering**: Modified `.bin` or `.safetensors` during transit
* **Fake Repositories**: Trojaned models uploaded with deceptive metadata

#### 🔥 Formats at Risk

* `.pt`, `.ckpt`, `.pkl`, `.joblib`, `.onnx`, `.safetensors`

#### 🛡️ Defenses

* Only load **non-executable formats** (e.g., Safetensors)
* Use model registries with integrity verification
* Hash and validate all downloaded artifacts

***

### ⚙️ 5. Inference Infrastructure

#### 🔻 Risks

* **Prompt Injection**: Hijacks model instructions via crafted inputs
* **Token Flooding (DoS)**: Excessive output crashes memory/CPU
* **Tool Abuse / RCE**: Untrusted inputs trigger plugins, subprocesses, API keys

#### 🧪 Real-World Examples

* Exposed FastAPI servers with no auth wrapping LLM endpoints
* LangChain agents executing `os.system()` on prompt content
* Malicious PDF causing LLM to fetch and summarize poisoned web pages

#### 🛡️ Defenses

* Wrap tools with authorization gates
* Add output token limits and timeout guards
* Isolate toolchains (via subprocess/containerization)

***

### 📊 6. Logging, Monitoring, and Post-Inference

#### 🔻 Risks

* **Sensitive Output Logging**: Leaking credentials or PII in logs
* **Prompt History Leakage**: Persisted unencrypted inputs/outputs
* **Lack of Attribution**: Untraceable attack vectors in audit logs

#### 🛡️ Best Practices

* Redact outputs before logging
* Structure logs with prompt UUIDs
* Record tool/plugin activations with source attribution
* Enable audit trails for LLM usage per user/session

***

### 📌 Summary

LLMs are **not vulnerable only at the prompt interface** — the entire pipeline is a **security-critical attack surface**:

```plaintext
[Data Collection] → [Pretraining] → [Fine-Tuning] → [Deployment] → [Inference] → [Monitoring]
```

> 📉 A single compromised dataset, model file, or LoRA adapter can create downstream catastrophic behaviors.

To build trustworthy LLM applications:

* Secure the **entire lifecycle**
* Assume models and inputs may be **adversarial by default**
* Shift from "model safety" to **pipeline integrity**
