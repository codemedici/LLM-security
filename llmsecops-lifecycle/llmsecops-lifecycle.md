# LLMSecOps Lifecycle

Secure your LLM from pre-training through deployment—continuous integration, delivery, monitoring, and response tailored specifically for LLM workflows.

## 🔄 LLM SecOps Stages Overview

| Stage                         | Description                               | Common Risks                                |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Pre-training**              | Dataset curation, initial model selection | Poisoned data, SBOM blind spots             |
| **Fine-tuning**               | Alignment, RLHF policy injection          | Policy backdoors, prompt leaks              |
| **Packaging & serialization** | Model export, containerization            | Serialized payload injection (Pickle/Keras) |
| **Deployment & inference**    | API gateways, embedding databases         | Prompt injection, vector poisoning          |
| **Monitoring & defense**      | Drift detection, observability            | Blind spots, evasion attacks                |

## 🆘 New: Identified Risks in MLOps → MLOops Transition (BH 2024)

The increased automation and complexity of MLOps into **"MLOops"** (Continuous Learning loops) significantly broadens the attack surface.

### ⚠️ MLOops Pitfalls

#### 1. Automation-Induced Blindness

* Continuous retraining → harder to detect subtle poisoning or drift
* Automated approval of model updates without thorough validation checks

**Recommended Mitigation:**

* Introduce gated checkpoints with manual or semi-automated verification steps
* Incremental differential validation tests (diff of model parameters, accuracy, fairness metrics)

***

#### 2. SBOM & Dependency Drift Blind Spots

* Containerized inference runtimes rarely updated or audited post-deployment
* Vulnerabilities discovered in libraries post-deployment can persist indefinitely

**Recommended Mitigation:**

* Regular CVE scanning & SBOM diff automation
* Automated rebuild & redeploy workflows for dependencies at least monthly

```yaml
- name: SBOM CVE Scan
  uses: anchore/scan-action@v3
```

***

#### 3. Poisoning via Continuous Data Intake

* Online learning pipelines ingest continuous new data (user-provided, third-party APIs)
* Adversarial input may subtly shift model behavior over time

**Recommended Mitigation:**

* Data drift monitoring with canary inputs
* Input filtering and validation on continuous streams
* Retraining rollback mechanism if drift exceeds thresholds

```python
if drift_metric(previous_model, updated_model) > threshold:
    trigger_rollback()
```

***

#### 4. Exploitable Infrastructure Components

* Increasingly complex chains: data lakes → feature stores → inference APIs
* Misconfiguration and overly permissive IAM roles across multi-tenant components

**Recommended Mitigation:**

* Infrastructure-as-code security checks (Terraform Sentinel, Open Policy Agent)
* Regular pentesting and IAM audits focused on least privilege enforcement

| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kubescape**                 | Kubernetes configuration scanning                    |
