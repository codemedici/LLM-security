# Automated Testing of LLMs

As LLM deployments scale, automated evaluation becomes essential. Manual red teaming doesn’t scale across use cases, models, or updates — automation fills that gap.

## What Are Automated LLM Evaluations?

Scripts, frameworks, or agents that:

* Generate adversarial prompts
* Feed them to the model systematically
* Score the outputs for violations or unsafe behavior
* Log and analyze results for trends or regressions

## Benefits of Automation

* Reproducibility
* High throughput
* Regression testing after model updates
* Quantitative metrics over qualitative intuition

## Common Evaluation Targets

* Jailbreak robustness
* Refusal consistency
* Toxicity scoring
* Hallucination detection
* Output determinism
* Tool/agent misuse

## Popular Testing Frameworks

| Tool        | Purpose                                |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| PyRIT       | Structured red team automation         |
| PromptBench | Prompt robustness benchmarking         |
| DeepChecks  | Automated evaluation for safety / bias |
| ART         | Adversarial robustness testing for NLP |
| AdvBench    | Prompt / output comparison framework   |

## Sample Testing Workflow

```python
from pyrit import RedTeamer

model = RedTeamer("openai:gpt-4")
results = model.test(
    category="jailbreaks",
    strategy="obfuscation",
    output_metrics=["toxicity", "policy_violations"]
)
results.to_csv("eval_output.csv")
```

## Evaluation Modes

* **Static**: Predefined prompts, deterministic output checks
* **Dynamic**: Adaptive prompts based on response feedback
* **Agentic**: Prompt chains using memory/tools to evaluate behavior over time

## Scoring & Metrics

| Metric              | Description                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| TPR / FPR           | True vs False Positive Rates           |
| Bypass Rate         | % of harmful outputs slipping through  |
| Refusal Consistency | Refuses same input every time?         |
| Output Diversity    | Does model hallucinate under pressure? |

## Summary

Automated evaluation helps catch regressions, scale testing, and compare models in structured ways.\
It’s not just a QA tool — it’s part of your security pipeline.
