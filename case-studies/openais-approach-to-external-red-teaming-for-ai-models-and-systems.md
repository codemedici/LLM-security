# OpenAI's Approach to External Red Teaming for AI Models and Systems

### Overview

OpenAI’s external red teaming process is a structured initiative aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and limitations in AI systems prior to deployment. The process includes selecting domain experts, establishing engagement boundaries, simulating realistic threat scenarios, and integrating red team insights into model and system improvements.

This case study details OpenAI’s framework for conducting red teaming with external experts, focusing on GPT-4 and ChatGPT, with the goal of mitigating real-world harm.

### Goals of External Red Teaming

* **Discover novel failure modes** not anticipated by internal teams.
* **Simulate realistic adversarial use** scenarios for large-scale deployed models.
* **Include diverse perspectives** and domain expertise across disciplines.
* **Improve overall model safety** and post-deployment monitoring.

***

### External Red Teaming Lifecycle

OpenAI’s process is organized into the following phases:

#### 1. Planning

* Identify threat models and risk domains.
* Recruit external red teamers with domain expertise.
* Define rules of engagement and scope.

#### 2. Execution

* Provide limited model access in secure environments.
* Red teamers probe for harmful outputs and systemic issues.
* Focus areas include: disinformation, cybercrime, biological threats, persuasion, privacy leakage, and jailbreak resilience.

#### 3. Evaluation

* Aggregate findings into categories (e.g., "unsafe responses", "coercion success", "bias induction").
* Determine whether failures are systematic or edge cases.
* Compare across baseline and fine-tuned model checkpoints.

#### 4. Remediation and Feedback

* Use red team insights to retrain or fine-tune models.
* Improve detection systems and usage policies.
* Update safety evaluations and public risk disclosures.

### Tools and Infrastructure

* **Red Teaming Platform:** A sandboxed web-based interface where red teamers submit prompts, analyze outputs, and report issues.
* **Data Logging:** Detailed capture of red team interactions, annotations, and failures.
* **Taxonomies:** Red teamers tag issues using shared taxonomies for safety, alignment, and reliability concerns.

***

### Case Highlights

* **Cybersecurity Testing:** Red teamers simulated phishing email generation, deepfake impersonation, and password guessing prompts. Results helped tune system prompts and refuse mechanisms.
* **Jailbreak Resilience:** Tested known and novel jailbreak patterns. Findings guided further model reinforcement against prompt leakage and instruction override.
* **Scientific Misuse:** Dual-use cases such as synthesizing controlled substances or biological agents were stress-tested. Models were updated to include content filters and better intent detection.

***

### Key Takeaways for Red Teamers

* Treat red teaming as **early-stage threat modeling** and validation.
* Collaborate across disciplines: involve experts in cybersecurity, psychology, law, biology, and social science.
* Use structured frameworks and taxonomy tagging for scalable feedback.
* Track efficacy of fixes post-red teaming to ensure regression resistance.
